        <ul> 
            <li>one can of chickpeas</li>
            <li>generous helpings of tahini from your local ethnic shop</li>
            <li>quite a bit of lemon juice</li>
            <li>couple garlic cloves</li>
            <li>sprinkle of salt</li>
            <li>throw in a few ice cubes</li>
            <li>palestinian olive oil (i'm sorry to say that <strong>no other olive oil will do</strong>)</li>
            <li>paprika & parsley (for that <em>je ne se qua</em>)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>And then here's what you'll wanna do pal: </p>

            <li>Search up hummus on your favourite food blog and follow the recipe</li>
            <li>I personally really like Feel Good Foodie</li>
            <li>Sorry, I don't know, drain the chickpeas?</li>
            <li>I'm really concerned about stealing someone else's content</li>
            <li>And I also don't <em>actually</em> know how to make hummus</li>
            <li>I should've thought this through</li>
            <li>I just really wanted to look at a picture of hummus</li>
            <li>And then you want to drizzle that Palestinian olive oil on top</li>
